# Unsharp Masking

This project demonstrates the unsharp masking technique for image enhancement in GNU Octave, focusing on sharpening and clarifying image details.

## Features

- Application of unsharp masking to enhance image sharpness.
- Customizable parameters for different levels of enhancement.
- Use of a sample image to illustrate the effect of the technique.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you to set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- GNU Octave (version 8.3.0 or later)
- Image and Statistics packages in Octave

### Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/annam015/Unsharp-Masking.git
```

## Usage

Open the `unsharpMasking.m` script in GNU Octave.
The script can be run as it is with the provided sample image, or you can modify the script to use a different image.
Upon running, the script will display both the original and the unsharp masked image for comparison.

## Understanding the Code

The `unsharpMasking.m` script applies a sharpening filter to the image, enhancing its clarity and detail. The script is easily adjustable, allowing for experimentation with different levels of sharpness.
